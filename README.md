# Cryptocurrency Dashboard

This cryptocurrency dashboard is built using **HTML 5**, **CSS 3**, **Bootstrap 5**, **Sass**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. The website uses the **CoinGecko API** to get cryptocurrency data such as live prices, trading volume, exchange volumes, historical data, crypto categories, images, and more.

### Prerequisites

Install the following prerequisites:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with two extensions installed: **Live Server** and **Live Sass Compiler**.
* [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) allows us to launch a local development server that enables a live reload of our project.
* [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) allows us to compile Sass files to CSS files in real time. It will watch a Sass file for changes, and then it will automatically compile that Sass file into a CSS file whenever a change is made and saved.

### Installation

#### Install required dependencies

From the **root** directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the application

To run the application, start the **Live Server** by clicking **Go Live** in the bottom right corner of the status bar in Visual Studio Code. This action will load the website in your default web browser.
